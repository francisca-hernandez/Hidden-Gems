# HiddenGems 

## Description

An pepole who lives in different parts of Oregon, we know there are a lot of touristy spots and places that are unknown except to locals and the lucky few that come across them. 

We built an app to be able to login and document and save the "hidden gems" you find in oregon to be able to keep for yourself or share with others. 

This is meant to be somewhere you can share them or keep them private on your dashboard and be able to see other's Gems and add new ones yourself. 

This is for the user that does not want to be another tourist and wants to see or just save the real gems of the beautiful state of Oregon.
